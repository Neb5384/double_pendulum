#double_pendulum

physics project that is a double pendulum simulation

##double_pendulum.jl
contains the physic equations, and the simulation with euler / RK4

##analysis.jl
analyses video to get the centroids of the masses, will be used to compare to simulation

##main.jl
will call both and make comparisons. (todo)
